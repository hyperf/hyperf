- [#5087](https://github.com/hyperf/hyperf/pull/5087) Support PHP 8.2;

## BC breaks

- The framework removes `@Annotation` support, and uses `PHP8` native annotation `Attribute`. Before updating, be sure to check whether the project has been replaced by `Attribute`.

The following script can be executed to convert `Doctrine Annotations` to `PHP8 Attributes`.

**Note: This script can only be executed under version 2.2**

```shell
composer require hyperf/code-generator
php bin/hyperf.php code:generate -D app
```

- Database Model upgrade script

> Because the model base class has added type support for member variables, you need to use the following script to upgrade it to a new version.

```shell
composer require hyperf/code-generator
php vendor/bin/regenerate-models.php $PWD/app/Model
```

- The framework adds more type restrictions to the class library, so when updating from `2.2` to `3.0`, you need to run a static check to make sure it is works.

```shell
composer analysis
```

- The framework modifies the `Http status` returned by `gRPC Server` according to the `gRPC` specification. It is fixed at 200, and `gRPC Server` returns the corresponding `status code`. Service upgrade to version 3.x
