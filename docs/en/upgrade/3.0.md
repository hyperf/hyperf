# 3.0 Upgrade Guide

- Version 3.0 mainly modifies `PHP`, the minimum version is `8.0`
- The framework removes `Doctrine Annotations` and uses `PHP8 Attributes` instead
- The framework adds a large number of member variable type restrictions

## Convert all annotations

**Note: This step can only be performed under version 2.2**

The following script will convert all `Doctrine Annotations` to `PHP8 Attributes`.

```shell
composer require hyperf/code-generator
php bin/hyperf.php code:generate -D app
```

## Modify all Hyperf component version

Simply change `hyperf/*` in `composer.json` to `3.0.*`.

> hyperf/engine does not follow the framework version number, so there is no need to modify it, just make sure it is version ^2.1.0

After that, you only need to execute `composer update -o`, and the upgrade can be completed normally.

## Upgrade the database model

Because the model base class adds type support for member variables, you need to use the following script to upgrade it to the new version.

```shell
composer require hyperf/code-generator
php vendor/bin/regenerate-models.php $PWD/app/Model
```

## Logger

`monolog/monolog` 3.x version uses the new features of PHP8.1, so some classes need to be specially modified

Modify `array $record` to `array|LogRecord $record` to be compatible with version 3.x, the sample code is as follows

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Kernel\Log;

use Hyperf\Context\Context;
use Hyperf\Coroutine\Coroutine;
use Monolog\LogRecord;
use Monolog\Processor\ProcessorInterface;

class AppendRequestIdProcessor implements ProcessorInterface
{
    public const REQUEST_ID = 'log.request.id';

    public function __invoke(array|LogRecord $record)
    {
        $record['extra']['request_id'] = Context::getOrSet(self::REQUEST_ID, uniqid());
        $record['extra']['coroutine_id'] = Coroutine::id();
        return $record;
    }
}

```

##Command

After the `3.0` version, the command line has an event listener enabled by default, so when a listener listens to the `Command` event and performs `AMQP` or other multiplexing logic, the process will not be able to exit.

Solution

- method one:

When executing the command, add the option `--disable-event-dispatcher`

- Method Two:

Add listener

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Listener;

use Hyperf\Command\Event\AfterExecute;
use Hyperf\Coordinator\Constants;
use Hyperf\Coordinator\CoordinatorManager;
use Hyperf\Event\Annotation\Listener;
use Hyperf\Event\Contract\ListenerInterface;

#[Listener]
class ResumeExitCoordinatorListener implements ListenerInterface
{
    public function listen(): array
    {
        return [
            AfterExecute::class,
        ];
    }

    public function process(object $event): void
    {
        CoordinatorManager::until(Constants::WORKER_EXIT)->resume();
    }
}
```

## Start the server

Next, you only need to start the server, and you can see the unsuitable code and modify them one by one.

- Added types for AMQP Consumer and Producer member variables
- The `process` method of the Listener adds a `void` return type
- Annotation `#[CircuitBreaker]` changed `$timeout` parameter to `$options.timeout`

## GRPC

The framework modifies the `Http status` returned by `GRPC Server` to be 200 according to the `GRPC` specification, and the `GRPC Server` returns the corresponding `status code`. Upgrade to the `3.x` version, otherwise the peer end cannot parse the error normally when the request is abnormal.
